# Project Objective
The objective of this study is to classify news articles into different groups based on TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features, focusing specifically on data from the BBC and the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

## Description of Datasets:
The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a widely used dataset in natural language processing and machine learning. It consists of approximately 20,000 documents from 20 different discussion groups.

The BBC dataset, on the other hand, is a collection of press articles from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) website. It is organized into different thematic categories.

## The proposed approach will be as follows:
1. Text preprocessing
2. Train/test split
3. Feature extraction based on TF-IDF
4. Classification using SVM (Support Vector Machine)
5. Comparison with the results of the reference model

## Work Details:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a term in a document relative to a corpus. It assigns a high weight to terms that are frequent in the document and rare in the entire corpus. This highlights distinctive and important terms.

SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. It seeks to find a hyperplane that best separates the different classes. It is effective even with non-linearly separable data through the use of kernel functions.

By using TF-IDF to extract document features and SVM for classification, we obtain a system capable of classifying documents based on their important characteristics. TF-IDF captures semantic aspects, and SVM finds the best separation between classes.
